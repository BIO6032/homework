## Evaluation criteria

All homework is graded on a total of 100 points.

**Model justification:** 10 points, including a discussion of the parameters and/or functional responses used

**Model analysis:** 30 points, including a discussion of possible mechanisms not captured by the model and their influence on the results

**Model implementation:** 50 points, sub-divided as follows: 15 points if the code runs properly, 10 points for writing functions, 10 points for proper function documentation and comments, 5 points for function and parameters naming, 10 points for appropriate data structure and representation

**Presentation:** 10 points, including language quality and structure of the text, as well as proper visualization of the results
