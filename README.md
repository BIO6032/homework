# BIO 6032 homework - {{ your name here }}

<!-- Unless explicitly indicated, do not change anything in this file -->

As part of your evaluation for the class, you need to turn in 11 reports, at a
rate of about one per week. These will form the entirety of your evaluation. The
reports must be written as executable markdown files. An example of the expected
work is given in the `homework/00_demonstration.Jmd`, and compiled [to this
webpage][demo]. This provides a template for your answers, and also gives an
overview of how to structure the documents.

[demo]: ./homework/00_demonstration/

The reports will be compiled automatically, to ensure that your work is fully
reproducible.

## Evaluation criteria

All homework is graded on a total of 100 points. In all cases, you must copy the
instructions (from Studium) into the first quote block, and then write an
introduction. Do not modify the headings of any of the sections, though you are
allowed to (and most definitely will need to) add third-level headings (`###
heading`).

**Model justification:** 10 points, including a discussion of the parameters and/or functional responses used

**Model analysis:** 30 points, including a discussion of possible mechanisms not captured by the model and their influence on the results

**Model implementation:** 50 points, sub-divided as follows: 15 points if the code runs properly, 10 points for writing functions, 10 points for proper function documentation and comments, 5 points for function and parameters naming, 10 points for appropriate data structure and representation

**Presentation:** 10 points, including language quality and structure of the text, as well as proper visualization of the results
