<!-- Unless explicitly indicated, do not change anything in this file -->

As part of your evaluation for the class, you need to turn in 11 reports, at a
rate of about one per week ([full instructions](/about)). You are free to submit
the assignments at a rhythm that suits you, however the theory required matches
with specific in-class readings and discussions. In addition, every assignment
represents a considerable amount of work, and it is not advised to wait until
later in the term to complete them. The assignments will form the entirety of
your evaluation. There is no extra credit for this class, and grades will not be
curved.
