## Evaluation criteria

All homework is graded on a total of 100 points. In all cases, you must copy the
instructions (from Studium) into the first quote block, and then write an
introduction. Do not modify the headings of any of the sections, though you are
allowed to (and most definitely will need to) add third-level headings (`###
heading`).

**Model justification:** 10 points, including a discussion of the parameters and/or functional responses used

**Model analysis:** 30 points, including a discussion of possible mechanisms not captured by the model and their influence on the results

**Model implementation:** 50 points, sub-divided as follows: 15 points if the code runs properly, 10 points for writing functions, 10 points for proper function documentation and comments, 5 points for function and parameters naming, 10 points for appropriate data structure and representation

**Presentation:** 10 points, including language quality and structure of the text, as well as proper visualization of the results
